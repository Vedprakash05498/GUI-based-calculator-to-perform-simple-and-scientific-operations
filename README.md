# GUI-based-calculator-to-perform-simple-and-scientific-operations


# write a python program using tkinter to create a GUI for simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.
 

# Hints:
Users choose the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, etc are valid.

Two (or more) numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section.

Using functions like add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(), hcf(), lcm(), power(), log(), etc. to evaluate respective operations.



## 2nd way program 
In this program, the user inputs two numbers in the fields and selects the desired operation from the dropdown menu. When the "Evaluate" button is pressed, the selected operation is evaluated using the corresponding function and the result is displayed in the output field.


# 3rd way program
This program uses tkinter to create a GUI for a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user can choose the desired operation by entering a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the "Operator" field. The calculate function evaluates the expression and displays the result in a label.
