# GUI-based-calculator-to-perform-simple-and-scientific-operations


# write a python program using tkinter to create a GUI for simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.
 

# Hints:
Users choose the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, etc are valid.

Two (or more) numbers are taken and an if…elif…else branching is used to execute a particular section.

Using functions like add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(), hcf(), lcm(), power(), log(), etc. to evaluate respective operations.



## In this program, the user inputs two numbers in the fields and selects the desired operation from the dropdown menu. When the "Evaluate" button is pressed, the selected operation is evaluated using the corresponding function and the result is displayed in the output field.
